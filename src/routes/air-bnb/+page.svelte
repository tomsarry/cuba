	The bus dropped me off at my third destination: Matanzas. This (little) costal city is spread out
	around a bay, and you get great views at night, with all the lights of the other side of the bay .
	I had booked 2 nights there, with a <i>superhost</i> (someone with great Air BNB ratings): Alay.

	Firstly, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried taking a shower and ABSOLUTELY no water came out.
	After a long warm day, that's just the best! They had AC however, so it wasn't too bad either.
	Except for the flock of roosters that, as soon as they saw a sliver of light at 5am (not even, the
	sun rises at 7, they were probably jetlagged), started a contest of who could be the loudest. I
	had planned to go for an early visit of the surroundings from 7 to 9am because I had told the host
	that I would have breakfast at 9am. I was therefore ready for adventure at 6:30am... only to find
	the front gate locked. Instead, I spent the morning reading, which was pretty nice, washing my
	clothes, and (finally) taking a shower, talk about a blessing in disguise! I met Joan, a german
	guy that was staying with the same host, a little before my breakfast, and one of my first
	questions was: "Oh they opened the door?" to which he responded: "Oh no I just climbed over it". I
	did not even think of that, I guess I'll know for next time...
