	Having spent two nights in La Havana, I had a skewed perception of prices in Cuba. The hostel's
	manager (at la Havana) had told me to count approximately 1000 pesos per meal + cocktail. I was
	pleasantly surprised that this didn't apply everywhere in Cuba. For instance, I ordered a mojito
	in Vi&ntilde;ales for 100 CUP and a meal for 500 CUP. But this was nothing compared to Matanzas! I
	started off my morning with a Guava juice (10 CUP). Then, on my way to a viewpoint, I saw a little
	store that sold coffees for 5 CUP (not a fresh espresso but still). After getting back from the
	viewpoint, that was totally worth it by the way (not a single tourist in sight!), I tried my luck
	at a "Gastronomic Restaurant" (its name, I'm not making that up). This place was pretty popular
	among locals (high schoolers eating after class, workers) and was very cheap: I paid 125 CUP for
	my meal.

	It was fried rice, I think, and the lady that served me scooped my meal from what had been a large
	paint bucket. For that price, I can't really complain. Although the meal was quite filling, on my
	way to the other side of the city, a street vendor caught my eye. This cart was selling little
	fried corn batter balls (I think), for 2 pesos each. Two pesos. A USD is worth 180CUP today
	(approximately). I had a dozen and they were quite good, I have to admit.

	Finally, at the other side of one of the bridges, I took a sugarcane juice (fresh), with little
	chunks of ice (same of the first juice of the day), and it was also one of the best juices I've
	ever had. This judgement was certainly influenced by the fact that it was extremely hot, and that
	I was thirsty, but sill, a very good juice for 20 CUP.
